# filmz

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Convex, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **React Native** - Build mobile apps using React
- **Expo** - Tools for React Native development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Convex** - Reactive backend-as-a-service platform
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system
- **Husky** - Git hooks for code quality
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Convex Setup

This project uses Convex as a backend. You'll need to set up Convex before running the app:

```bash
bun dev:setup
```

Follow the prompts to create a new Convex project and connect it to your application.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Use the Expo Go app to run the mobile application.
Your app will connect to the Convex cloud backend automatically.
